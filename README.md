# Bird Time

## Description
It's a shame that a developer had removed their program out of guilt. He witnessed his user enraged and decided to discontinue a game that was the cause of misfortune, Flappy Bird.

A unique platformer with a strange concept of flight. You are the bird trys to get by, but Mario pipes wants to get in its way. For some reason, you are very fragile, so precision is key.

## MVP Goals
One of the first forms of functionality I need to do is the hopping of the bird.
Then, create pipes that will randomize the gap of the pipes, and make the pipes go towards the bird
- press the space bar key to start the game
- control the bird's hopping by clicking on the spacebar
- create pipes as obstacles
- create a function where pipes move towards the bird as soon as the game starts
- repeat the pipe function so that endless amounts of pipes go towards the bird, with different position of the gaps
- stop the game if the bird's hitbox comes in contact with the pipe
- bring up a board to show you your results and a button to redo/play again

## STRETCH Goals
- adding 'skins' to the game -- ability to change the bird's appearance
- provide the bird an animation by facing up and down depending on the process of the hopping
- provide a background with animation to display movement
