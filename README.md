It's a shame that a developer had removed their program out of guilt. He witnessed his user enraged and decided to discontinue a game that was the cause of misfortune, Flappy Bird.

A unique platformer with a strange concept of flight. You are the bird trys to get by, but Mario pipes wants to get in its way. For some reason, you are very fragile, so precision is key.


//TechStack
This project will consist of canvas (please)
and will be formatted like a 2012 web games like y3 or y8


//Wireframes
The website will consist of header, footer, 2 aside divs, and a main div in between.
The main div will be divided into two: canvas and a description.
The footer will be including information nobody really looks at.


//MVP Goals
One of the first forms of functionality I need to do is the hopping of the bird.
Then, create pipes that will randomize the gap of the pipes, and make the pipes go towards the bird

Afterwards, I need to end the game if a collision occurs.
