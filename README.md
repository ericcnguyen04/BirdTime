# Bird Time

## Description
It's a shame that a developer had removed their program out of guilt. He witnessed his user enraged and decided to discontinue a game that was the cause of misfortune, Flappy Bird.

A unique platformer with a strange concept of flight. You are the bird that is trying to get by, but Mario pipes wants to get in the way. For some reason, you are very fragile, so precision is key.

This game is an endless platformer and will continue until the player has collided with the obstacles. The goal is to get as many points as possible! As simple as it may sound, it does bring out your competitive nature!

## Approach
I believed that the best approach is to set up the wireframe and frame the canvas. After a quick and simple layout, I started on creating the game in canvas to reach my MVP. My first steps was creating an entity for bird and providing characteristics of hopping. Then, I created two new entities representing the pipes. Once I created movement for the pipes, I created lose conditions by detecting any connection between the bird and the pipes or ground.

## Technology Used
I used canvas and classes to create entities and render. Functions were a crucial concept that was used many times throughout this project. Keybinds and math functionalities are also used to create concepts of the game!

## TechStack
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

## Wireframe

This project will consist of canvas
and will be formatted like a 2012 web games like y3 or y8

Title: Bird Time
Header: with a logo and additonal user features (log in) mainly for design rather than actually logging in
Two Aside: used as borders to center the canvas, the aside will be a background to set the theme of the website
Canvas: the main scene of where the game will take place
Section: below the canvas is the description of the game, and the controls
Footer: a footer will be at the bottom of the page for design purposes


## MVP Goals
One of the first forms of functionality I need to do is the hopping of the bird.
Then, create pipes that will randomize the gap of the pipes, and make the pipes go towards the bird
- press the w key to start the game
- control the bird's hopping by clicking on the spacebar
- create pipes as obstacles
- create a function where pipes move towards the bird as soon as the game starts
- repeat the pipe function so that endless amounts of pipes go towards the bird, with different position of the gaps
- stop the game if the bird's hitbox comes in contact with the pipe
- bring up a board to show you your results and a button to redo/play again

## STRETCH Goals
- adding 'skins' to the game -- ability to change the bird's appearance
- provide the bird an animation by facing up and down depending on the process of the hopping
- provide a background with animation to display movement

## Post Project Reflection
A very challenging, yet achievable project. As I pitched this project, I believed it was too hard of a challenge for me to start with, but I was motivated and passionate to complete it!

During the process, it felt impossible sometimes. Research was done and nothing felt more alive after figuring out a problem, whether it's debugging or adding features.

It is absolutely absolutely wild how I designed this within three weeks of committing to coding. I am very proud of what I accomplished and I never felt more productive, genuinely.
